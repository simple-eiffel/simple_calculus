## Research Quality Metrics

References cited: 8+ (NumPy, SciPy, GSL, Boost Math, papers, Stack Overflow)
Alternatives researched: 3 (NumPy/SciPy, GNU GSL, Boost Math)
Requirements defined: 16 (10 functional, 6 non-functional)
Decisions documented: 5 (with options, rationale, reversibility)
Risks identified: 5 (with likelihood, impact, mitigations)
Innovations documented: 4 (vs existing solutions)

## Recommendation

**Action:** BUILD
**Confidence:** HIGH

**Rationale:**
1. Gap exists - Eiffel ecosystem has no calculus library
2. MVP viable - Numerical methods well-understood, implementable in pure Eiffel
3. Use case validated - Physics simulations (wave equation, Maxwell, Schrödinger) need derivatives/integrals
4. API design clear - Agent-based function passing is idiomatic Eiffel
5. Error control possible - Design by Contract catches issues early

## Scope Summary

### In Scope (MVP - v1.0.0)
- Numerical derivatives (forward, backward, central difference)
- Numerical integration (trapezoidal, Simpson's rule)
- Error estimation for both operations
- Partial derivatives for multi-variable functions
- Adaptive step size selection

### Deferred to Phase 2+
- Automatic differentiation (forward/reverse mode)
- Symbolic differentiation rules
- Adaptive quadrature (advanced)
- C-optimized performance paths

## Key Design Decisions

D-001: Numerical primary (symbolic deferred)
D-002: Adaptive h selection (no fixed step size)
D-003: Trapezoidal + Simpson's (no advanced quadrature)
D-004: Agent-based functions (Eiffel idiomatic)
D-005: Skip MML for numerics (light weight)

## Risk Management

5 risks identified:
- RISK-001: Ill-conditioned functions (MEDIUM/MEDIUM) → Mitigated with error bounds
- RISK-002: Performance on high derivatives (MEDIUM/MEDIUM) → Focus on 1st derivatives
- RISK-003: Discontinuous integration (MEDIUM/HIGH) → Preconditions validate smoothness
- RISK-004: Symbolic conflict (LOW/MEDIUM) → Design compatible interface
- RISK-005: Eiffel performance (LOW/MEDIUM) → Correctness first, optimize if needed

## Dependencies

### Required
- simple_math (basic arithmetic)
- base (ISE allowed - fundamental types)
- testing (ISE allowed - EQA_TEST_SET)

### Future Integrations
- simple_probability (stochastic integration)
- simple_montecarlo (MC integration)
- simple_linalg (Jacobian matrices)
- simple_ode (for Phase 2)

## Simple_* First Policy Validation

✅ Checked ecosystem - no simple_calculus exists
✅ Checked ISE stdlib - no native calculus library
✅ Checked Gobo - no calculus support
✅ Conclusion: Must BUILD

## Success Criteria Status

All criteria defined and measurable:
- Derivative accuracy: < 1e-6 relative error (testable)
- Integration accuracy: < 1e-5 relative error (testable)
- Test coverage: 50+ unit tests (countable)
- Void safety: void_safety="all" (compiler-enforced)
- SCOOP: concurrency="scoop" (compiler-enforced)
- Documentation: GitHub Pages site (deliverable)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Research COMPLETE
2. ⏳ Run `/eiffel.spec` to transform research into 8-step specification
3. ⏳ Run `/eiffel.intent` to capture refined intent
4. ⏳ Run `/eiffel.contracts` through `/eiffel.ship` for full workflow

## Overall Assessment

Research is COMPREHENSIVE, EVIDENCE-BASED, and ACTIONABLE.
No critical gaps identified. Ready to proceed to specification phase.

Status: RESEARCH_COMPLETE - Ready for /eiffel.spec
