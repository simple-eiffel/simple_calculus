# Phase 0 Intent Evidence
# Project: simple_calculus
# Date: 2026-01-29 14:35 UTC

## Completion Status

Intent document: .eiffel-workflow/intent-v2.md
AI review conducted: YES
AI used for review: Claude Code (local, in-process)
Questions answered: 7 (all clarifications resolved)
User approved: YES

## Intent Versions

intent.md (v1): Initial intent from specification
intent-v2.md (v2): Refined intent incorporating AI review answers

## Decisions Locked In

✅ MML Decision: NO (pure scalar computation, no collections)
✅ simple_* First: ENFORCED (only simple_math + ISE allowed)
✅ Void Safety: ALL (void_safety="all" in ECF)
✅ SCOOP Compatible: YES (stateless facades)

## AI Review Answers

1. Adaptive step size scaling: Keep simple formula, document assumption (|f(x)| ~ O(1))
2. Method comparison: All three computed, status based on agreement (CONVERGED/WARNING/FAILED)
3. Error estimation: Comparison between methods (no extra function evals)
4. Jacobian timing: Phase 2 (partial derivatives in Phase 1)
5. Tier 3 expert access: Factory method (create_derivative_calculator)
6. Monte Carlo integration: Tier 2 option flag (Phase 2 implementation)
7. Test functions: Standard numerical analysis set (x², x³, sin, cos, exp, ln)

## Key Clarifications

- Adaptive h = sqrt(ε) × max(|x|, 1.0) with assumption |f(x)| ~ O(1)
- Error bound = max(|f'_fwd - f'_cent|, |f'_bwd - f'_cent|) computed for free
- CONVERGENCE_STATUS: CONVERGED (all agree), WARNING (2 agree), FAILED (all differ)
- Phase 1: partial_derivative only; Phase 2: Jacobian assembly convenience
- Test accuracy: Standard 6 functions across scales [1e-10, 1e10]
- Phase 1 focused on 1st derivatives; Phase 2 adds higher-order

## Status

PHASE 0 COMPLETE: Intent refined and approved.

✅ All ambiguities clarified
✅ All decisions documented
✅ AI review completed locally
✅ intent-v2.md ready for Phase 1
